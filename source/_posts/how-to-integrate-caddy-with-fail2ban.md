[Fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban) is an awesome security tool for servers. It allows to define rules (such as maximum number of failed SSH login attempts per time period) to temporarily IP-ban attackers or at least clients with suspicious behavior. I use it to lock out anyone who is repeatedly failing to establish an SSH session. In addition, I recently decided I also wanted to use it on a webserver level to block any potential attacker, e.g. anyone who is received a lot of `401` HTTP responses within short time. 

The way fail2ban works is by continuously analyzing log files with regexes and taking action (usually creating a blocking `iptables` entry for the respective client IP) when certain criteria are met (too many matches for same IP within certain time span). It comes with a ton of pre-defined filter rules for all kinds of different application logs, e.g. for sshd, nginx, httpd, MySQL, MongoDB any others. I'm using [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) as a webserver, though, and there are no filters for Caddy included. So I had to come up with my own.

Before Caddy [removed support for Common Log Format (CLF)](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/4148), you could easily just use the nginx filter rules for Caddy as well. But today, Caddy writes its request logs as JSON by default. They look like so:

```json

```

([Single entry formatted](https://pastr.de/p/yqvropjspbed0pzn8upj27g8))

I came up with the following filter rule, which includes a (probably not optimal) regex for extracting the remote IP address and date from these JSON lines.

```
# /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/caddy-status.conf

[Definition]
failregex = ^.*"remote_ip":"<HOST>",.*?"status":(?:401|403|500),.*$
ignoreregex =
datepattern = LongEpoch
```

This will watch for requests with `401`, `403` or `500` response codes. You may add others in addition.

The according section in `jail.local` looks like this:

```
# /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
# ...

[caddy-status]
enabled     = true
port        = http,https
filter      = caddy-status
logpath     = /var/log/caddy/*.access.log
maxretry    = 10
```

Besides the `iptables-multiport` ban action, I'm using the `abuseipdb` action for additionally reporting all blocked IPs to [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/).
